# 📦 Archived Site

This repository contains all my archived sites, AlecsCP, blogging systems, the lofi player, and my old CMS. Feel free to use it however you'd like!

## ⚠️ Word of Warning

This repository is likely to contain messy, poorly written code that is extremely unoptimized and broken. You are advised to view/use this code at your own risk.

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Info

The backend is mostly written in PHP 8.0, and the Apache HTTP server was used (for managing .htaccess files). This website used to be hosted on Hostinger's shared web hosting plan.
