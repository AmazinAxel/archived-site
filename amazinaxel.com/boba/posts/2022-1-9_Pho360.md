# Pho 360 (Bellingham)
Another really good boba place is sort of a hidden gem. They don't really advertise boba so its harder to find online, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cw48dYxhP2opd5Zs5">but its Pho 360, found near the Puget area of Bellingham, Washington</a>. Their pearls are great, and the tea is decent as well. It feels a little more traditional, since they serve asian food there as well. When I went there the first time, I did not ask for ice and they filled more than half the cup with ice! The majority of the tea was just ice and it feels like they cheaped out on us there. Next time we went there, we asked for no ice and they didn't fill the entire thing up, about a quarter of the cup was empty since they usually filled the quarter with ice. The boba is priced fairly, tastes good, but you get a lot of ice. 6 out of 10 boba pearls.
