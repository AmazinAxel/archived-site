# Ding Tea (Lacey, Washington)
Ding Tea near Olympia (the capital of Washington State) has been the best boba we had since we had started our trip to Seattle. Honestly, this boba is just amazing and we couldn't get enough of it! The tea tastes amazing and they were extremely generous with the toppings! I got their Roaring Tiger milk tea and was honestly the best tiger-based milk tea I have ever had! The atmosphere of this place was also extremely nice and modern (which I prefer) and you could tell that they were the real deal. They have more stores around the Seattle and Puget Sound area (some are in Lakewood, Covington, Kent, Renton, University District in Seattle, and Lynnwood) and they all are in a great enviornment. I would rate this place a solid 8/10 boba pearls because they had great tea, toppings, and enviornment, but I would have to say that their combos are not as good as Sharetea level and the name, Ding Tea, is kind of weird. Keep it up Ding Tea!
