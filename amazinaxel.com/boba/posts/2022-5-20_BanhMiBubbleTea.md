# Banh Mi Bubble Tea (Bellingham, Washington)
Another bubble tea place has opened up just after Bellis Boba had their grand opening! These guys just opened a week ago and I would have to say that this place is by far better than Bellis Boba. The bubble tea here was absolutely amazing and the tea was just great. They also had good banh mi sandwiches and other traditional Thai drinks. The tea was very flavourful and was just perfect. The rainbow lychee was also really good, but I think that they put too little considering they charged extra for the toppings. My last complaint is that there was just wayy too much ice in the drink and watered down the drink. Other than that, this is one of my favorite bubble tea places in Bellingham and we will definitely be coming back here for their Banh Mi and bubble tea (but I will order it with no ice and extra toppings next time!) It's honestly great to see so many bubble tea places opening up in Bellingham and is really giving great competition to make better bubble tea here and more options for me.
