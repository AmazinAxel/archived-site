# Urban Fox (Boise, Idaho)
Urban Fox (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/JGwwoF762bdAcMpA9">Meridian, Idaho, suburb of Boise</a>) was one of my least favorite bubble tea places. My tea that I had ordered had tea that tasted like you let Lucky Charms cereal mix with milk for 2 hours and then just drank the milk. The color also had looked like you dumped a whole bunch of those blue Lucky Charms marshmellows and mixed it with milk. During the time we had gone there, one of the only boba options was Popping Lychee which had popped in the tea before you even got to drink it. This made the drink taste like Lucky Charms cereal mixed with Lychee jellies, that had been watered down with the ice that had been added to the drink. I would have to say that the store had a very nice interiror and that the staff were kind. Maybe this is biased because of the heat and the boba shortage, so I bumped the review up to 2 boba pearls.
