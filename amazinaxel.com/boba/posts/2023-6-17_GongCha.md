# Gong Cha (Coquitlam, BC)
Gong Cha is located right in the heart of Coquitlam, BC, a very large suburb of Vancouver. It's right in this Korean mini-mall in the nicer part of Coquitlam near the Coquitlam Center. When we first walked into the store, it felt extremely authentic. It felt like Sharetea quality as soon as we entered. There were awesome decorations, views of the skyscrapers, and the vibes were *amazing*. We got our teas quickly, and my first impressions of my drink were mixed. The boba was perfectly chewy, however the tea wasn't so great. I felt adventerous and tried a new flavor (a Strawberry Passionfruit tea with added grass jelly) but I ended up not enjoying the tea. I also hadn't expected for there to be any seeds, which made enjoying the drink a bit harder. Overall, I think my toppings were perfect, but the tea could use a bit of improvement. Maybe it's because I'm more of a milk tea person rather than straight-up tea, but this was a great experience nonetheless. I would rate this place 7 out of 10 boba pearls. 

Also, here's a picture of what the store looked like, with some Coquitlam skyscrapers in the back because why not??
