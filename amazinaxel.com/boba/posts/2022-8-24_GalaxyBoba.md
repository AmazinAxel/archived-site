# Galaxy Boba (Olympia, Washington)
Galaxy Boba is one of those really fun and unique bubble tea stores. I haven't seen anything like this before and their take on this is actually really cool. What they did is they combined multiple themes with bubble tea and created a really cool enviornment, mixed with Star Wars, space-age stuff and, of course, bubble tea! They also have an amazing logo and a unique storefront that stands out from the rest of downtown Olympia (well, except for the Capitol building!) But other than the amazing vibes the store gave, the bubble tea was kind of dissapointing. I mean, the tea wasn't actually the *worst* thing ever, but it could have been better. I also would have to say that the boba was a little bland and generic, but just looking at that logo made me want to drink more of it. I would rate this place a decent 6/10 boba pearls, because the enviornment was amazing but the bubble tea wasn't so much.
