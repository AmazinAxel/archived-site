# Mochinut (Bellingham, WA)
Mochinut is a cool and very unique boba shop. Instead of a traditional boba cup, they actually give you a *can* of boba with the same lid as something like a can of soda. They had many, many unique flavors, and luckily it wasn't just powder (we saw them make it) and it actually wasn't too bad. We did think that the prices there were kind of expensive and wasn't really worth what they wanted. It seemed more like an upscale, college crowd kind of thing. We had gone at a very bad time where there were many people and the store was jam packed with people! The store also sells a bunch of different food items, like hot dogs and different sauces. The decorations were something unique, but I didn't like the fact that it was next to a Cannabis store, and had the cannabis store's logo inside the shop!! Overall, I had a very mixed experience with many different downsides, and the boba itself was meh. It wasn't really impressive, and the boba wasn't all that great. Their selection wasn't all that good either, but you really can't expect all too much from something that started out in Hawaii! I would go back here again, but it wouldn't be a thing we would go to a lot. My mixed experience with this place makes me rate it a 5/10 Boba Pearls.
