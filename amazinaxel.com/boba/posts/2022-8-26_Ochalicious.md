# Ochalicious (Bellingham, Washington)
I was so hyped for this place when I heard that it was opening and I waited almost an entire month! And, I was not disappointed. The bubble tea here was on par with Bliss Tea, the best bubble tea place in town. This already is a great thing, but just wait until you walk into this place! I mean, they just opened, and the vibes this place gave me was already amazing! The people in there were friendly, the menu had a lot of options for dessert (including waffles!!) and they even had all the toppings you would expect from a high end bubble tea store! I honestly was really impressed with this place and I can't wait what this store is going to hold for us in the future. This place deserves an 8/10 boba rating, even if it is located in one of the more sketchy parts of downtown. Good work, Ochalicious!
