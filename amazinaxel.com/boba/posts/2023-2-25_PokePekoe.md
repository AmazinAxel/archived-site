# Poke Pekoe (Tulalip, WA)  
Poke Pekoe is a fun and unique boba shop that sells Poke bowls and boba! I haven't seen this combo before, but it's certainly unique! This shop is located in an outward facing outlet mall in the northern suburbs of Seattle, and it was actually decently good. The prices were good, and the boba was average. The tea was definitely better than many other boba shops I've been to, and the service was decent. They also sold Poke bowls with various different toppings. They only had 1 person running the shop so it took a while to get the boba. The tea was good and they had filled it up to the top, and they were very generous on the portions given with the boba and pudding. In the same mall, there is a Bliss Tea near this Poke bar, and comparably, they are very similar in terms of tea quality and boba. This place does also have one of my favorite toppings, Red Bean, which Bliss Tea does not. Finally, this place is also near Sharetea, and comparably, Sharetea is a bit better than this place. Overall, I would rate this boba shop a solid 8.5/10.
