# Happy Lemon (Bellingham, WA)
## This review also applies to other Happy Lemon locations around the Seattle / Puget Sound area.
Happy Lemon is a really professional and quality bubble tea company that is based in Taiwan. Because of this, you can expect that the quality of Happy Lemon boba shops would be good, especially if its a chain that's all around the world. I was not disappointed by this place, and the quality is comparable to Sharetea. They had a wide variety of different topings and flavors. They also had a bunch of different food items, like their world-famous Salted Cheese series, or their also as famous bubble waffles. They had so many different options, and everything was so well decorated and professional! Just by walking into the store, you could already smell the sweet tea, boba, and everything they were making. Their boba was well cooked, the pudding was very soft and also very well cooked, and all other toppings were great. The tea was also very good, but not as good as Sharetea. My only complaint is that some of the newer workers don't know how to make the drinks as well so sometimes the drinks aren't as good as normal. Other than that, this is a very solid bubble tea chain that I would recommend, other than Sharetea! I would definitely go back to this place, and rate it an astounding 9.5/10 Boba Pearls.
