# BITE Terriyaki & Pho (Mt. Vernon)
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/AGJPhLqtQnirRDnUA">BITE Terriyaki and Pho in Mt. Vernon, Washington</a> is now one of my favorite boba places in the area. We have been wanting to go to this place for many months now, and the wait really paid off since the boba was amazing. The tea was pretty good, but over time it got progressively worse as the ice started melting. They definitely did not cheap out, as the boba at the bottom was plentiful. They also offer some food there as well (we did not try it) and it even had the traditiional plastic lids! Definitely would rate this place a solid 8 out of 10 boba pearls.
