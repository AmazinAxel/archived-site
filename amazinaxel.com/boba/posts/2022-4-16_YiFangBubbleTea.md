# Yi Fang Bubble Tea (Sammammish, Washington)
Yi Fang bubble tea (located in Sammamish, WA, suburb of eastern Seattle) feels very traditional and has great boba. Their grass jelly is my favorite boba to get there, and they did a great job mixing in the different type of teas in my trio drink. The pictures online show that the drink is made with actual tea leaves which may be the reason to why this boba is just so good, and it is definitely a competitor to my favorite commercial bubble tea place, Sharetea. The prices for the drinks were very competitive and is a great value. This boba place is also located in a great area since you can get everything done in just 1 mall! You can get acai bowls from Emerald City Smoothies, get groceries at Trader Joes, get your food at the different restraunts in Sammamish (TacoTime, DQ, McDonalds, Vinason...) and top it all off with a bubble tea here at Yi Fang! This location is also only less than half an hour from downtown Seattle, which makes it a great option for Seattleites to come here to get their boba and escape the traffic. Overall, the tea is great, the price is great, and the location is great, so I give this boba a solid 9/10 boba pearls! (Note: if I come back here and have another great experience, there is a high chance that this rating may become a 10/10!)
