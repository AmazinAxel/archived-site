# Koi D Bar (Salt Lake City, Utah)
Koi D Bar (near <a href="https://g.page/Koi-D-Bar-Rolled-Ice-Cream?share">Downtown Salt Lake City, Utah</a>) was the first bubble tea place I tried in Salt Lake, and our experience here was not great. The store was clean and extremely popular (but it was near downtown which is understandable) but my bubble tea just didn't stack up with the rest of the competition. My tea was extra sweet and they also didn't have tapioca pearls here, so I had to get popping lychee again. Of course, the popping boba had already popped in the tea before you could drink it and made the drink taste like lychee. This place was slightly better than Boise but I still wouldn't recommend it. I would blame these bad experiences slightly on the awful heat and the boba shortage of 2021, which sort of ruined bubble tea places during this time.
