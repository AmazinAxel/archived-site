# Happy Lemon Coming to Bellingham!!
Thats right! The famed Happy Lemon is actually coming to Bellingham! The beloved Bubble Tea shop is making it's way to Sunset Square, where they will be serving bubble waffles, bubble tea and all sorts of cool drinks! They should be opening up pretty soon, so drive by their storefront and check in on them! You guys won't even believe how excited I am of this place coming to Bellingham, I have been waiting for sooo long for an amazing bubble tea place to come, and this place should fit everything we want out of a bubble tea place, and more! I hope to be writing an AMAZING review of this place once it opens!
