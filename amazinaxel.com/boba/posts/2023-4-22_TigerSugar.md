# Tiger Sugar (Seattle, WA)  
This bubble tea shop has a unique location compared to the rest that I've reviewed. I've always reviewed bubble tea shops in suburban cities and suburbs, like Bellingham and Sammammish, but this is the first time that this review is from a very large city! As you can expect, their prices were higher and their quantity was lower, but the experience was still unforgettable! <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Yp6XX2kZMGLTjaXY6">This location</a> was right in the middle of the Pike Place Market district and the (very busy but very cool) Central Buisness District right in the heart of Seattle! As you can expect, there were skyscrapers surrounding this boba shop and nice modern buildings everywhere. Even though we're very close to downtown Seattle, this is one of my first times really walking around the city and getting a feel for it, and I have to say that it's truly awesome! The vibes were honestly amazing and it's safe to say that it's my favorite city. Anyways, the boba was about average, however I thought the store was well decorated and very authentic. There were 2 order kiosks and the place was packed, but luckily it didn't take them very long to finish our order. They had many cute decorations and featured many of the traditional types of bubble tea, however they mainly specialize in Tiger Milk Tea, as stated in their name. I had to try their flagship drink but we tried many other various fruit tea drinks. Overall, the bubble tea was subpar because the cups were very small (although they do have a larger option which is more expensive) and the tea itself was nothing too special. My drink was surprisingly warm, however I had ordered it without ice. They included mini boba along with the large boba which was a surprise but ended up actually being very good. The boba was well cooked and the tea was fresh, and the service was quick, even when the shop was very busy. Overall, I would say this place doesn't rank as high as Happy Lemon or ShareTea, but if you're in the Pike Place Market area or just hopped off the monorail at the Westlake Center station and want a quick stop for bubble tea, this is a great place! I would rate this place a 7 out of 10 boba pearls.

## I also took a picture of their cool tiger decorations in their shop. Check it out!
