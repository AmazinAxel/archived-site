# Bliss Tea (Bellingham)
Another place which has decent boba is sort of <a href="https://g.page/bliss-tea-bellingham?share">close to downtown Bellingham, Washington and its called Bliss Tea</a>. It has decent boba, the cups might be a little small and the price is a bit high, but it is one of my favorite boba places in Bellingham. (7 out of 10 boba pearls)
