# QQ Li's Chinese Cuisine (Bellingham, Washington)
We just went to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/EEJXDAQoPmnyZTeg9">QQ Li's Chinese Cuisine in the Viking's Plaza</a> (near the college) in Bellingham, Washington and the first impressions of this place wasn't that good. They had a sort of run down place but it was right next to the college, and because of Bellingham's many colleges, it makes it a college town. Many students can't afford expensive food so the Vikings Plaza serves cheap Chinese food, Mexican food, pizza and more. But, the quality of the food isn't the greatest so you can expect to pay a lower price for lower quality food. This makes this boba place a meh place, its good for cheaper boba and you get a lot of boba pearls in it, but the restraunt is sort of run down and the tea is okay. It is not the greatest bubble tea but its not awful, so I definitely rate this place 5 boba pearls. (it doesnt have the traditional boba seal btw!)
