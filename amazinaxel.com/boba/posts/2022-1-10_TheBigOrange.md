# The Big Orange (Bellingham)
The Big Orange is inside the Bellis Fair mall in the food court, and its located in Bellingham, Washington</a>. The boba here was fine, the tea was pretty good but it was inside the mall which made it harder to get to (especially during the pandemic, when its inside a food court it can be very easy to get sick with others nearby) the boba pearls were extra soft, and they might have been a little old. I would rate it a solid 6 out of 10 boba pearls.
