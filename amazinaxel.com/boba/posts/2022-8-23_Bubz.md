# Bubz Boba (Bremerton, Washington)
Bubz is located in this weird medical building next to a bunch of doctors. The location was extremely weird but I like the theme! Our milk tea was watered down and they weren't as generous as Sharetea or Ding Tea, but they took a unique take to boba with a Hawaiian theme. Located near the heart of Bremerton, our experience was great. Overall, the place had a unique theme but very generic bubble tea. They also served really unique desserts and treats, but the bubble tea was a little bit of a let down. I would rate this place a 5 out of 10 boba pearls.
