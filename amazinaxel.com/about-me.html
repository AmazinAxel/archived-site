I focus more on developing websites and creating things using the web. Of course, I am very proficient at HTML and CSS, but I'm still learning PHP and JavaScript. I also am very good with Skript (a Minecraft coding language for servers) and handling / managing Linux servers. I also have (less in-depth) experience with video editing and creating Roblox games.</p></div>

    <h1>Skill Chart</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I've been making websites and games for many years, however I'm still learning new things! These progress bars shows an approximate amount of my proficiency in that skill. 100% proficiency would mean that I'm very knowledgeable with that skill and may have some knowledge about some related libraries or frameworks if it's a language, and 0% would mean that I know basically nothing about it. </p>
    
    <div class="tooltip" style="--language: 'Hugo';"> <div class="progress">
        <div class="progressinner" style="width: 25%;"> 25% </div></div>
    <span class="tooltiptext">Hugo is a JAMstack static site generator written in Go. It allows you to easily create a static site, but uses APIs. I've been experimenting with Hugo and Static Site Generators over at <a href="https://blog.amazinaxel.com">my blog.</a> I don't have too much experience yet, but I'm also learning how to use Cloudflare Pages because it's a stable method of hosting websites and is totally free. I'm also learning GIT while doing this because the repository is hosted on GitHub.</span> </div>

    
    <div class="tooltip" style="--language: 'Node.js';"> <div class="progress">
        <div class="progressinner" style="width: 10%;"> 10% </div></div>
    <span class="tooltiptext">I am learning Node.js as an alternative to PHP. Although I do really like PHP, it may not be as useful in the future, so I'm learning Node.js to create future web applications. I don't know much about it yet, but Cloudflare Workers allows you to create free but simple Node.js applications on the edge. Node.js is a back-end web development enviornment that is written in JavaScript. It's simple enough and very fast. It uses JavaScript as its language but leverages it to build server-side code, and it can be used as a full-stack alternative for JavaScript, as it can be used on the client-side and the server-side. </span> </div>
    
    <div class="tooltip" style="--language: 'Python';"> <div class="progress">
        <div class="progressinner" style="width: 20%;"> 20% </div></div>
    <span class="tooltiptext">Python is a very simple language that is very heavily used. It is extremely popular and has a large amount of frameworks. It can be used with AI and web development and it is very versatile. I got familiar with Python in 2021 when I started learning about how it worked, and I'm still in the process of learning how to use it. I am also learning Django (above), but I don't have any other knowledge of any other frameworks.</span> </div>
        
    <div class="tooltip" style="--language: 'PHP';"> <div class="progress">
            <div class="progressinner" style="width: 75%;"> 75% </div></div>
        <span class="tooltiptext">This is my main language of choice when it comes to back-end development. PHP is an easy-to-use language that is super simple to set up. I create most of my back-end panels with PHP and I am very experienced with PHP. I have been experimenting with PHP projects since 2021. I have created multiple large projects with PHP and many features of this site is also coded in PHP.</span> </div>
    
    <div class="tooltip" style="--language: 'HTML';"> <div class="progress">
            <div class="progressinner" style="width: 100%;"> 100% </div></div>
        <span class="tooltiptext">HTML is a markup language that allows you to create websites. It is a very basic and easy-to-learn language. I already know most things about how HTML works and I have been using it since 2018. I do prefer to use Markdown whenever possible for formatting because of its simplicity.</span> </div>
        
    <div class="tooltip" style="--language: 'Skript';"> <div class="progress">
            <div class="progressinner" style="width: 100%;"> 100% </div></div>
        <span class="tooltiptext">Skript is a language for coding Minecraft-based things. You can use it to create minigames, custom items, and more without having to use any Java! It is very simple and is written in plain English. I have used it to create many, many games and I'm still using it to create more projects! Skript is a good language for beginners that want to get used to creating Minecraft games without having to dive deep with Java.</span> </div>
        
    <div class="tooltip" style="--language: 'CSS';"> <div class="progress">
            <div class="progressinner" style="width: 85%;"> 85% </div></div>
        <span class="tooltiptext">CSS is a very basic styling engine for webpages. It allows you to style and structure a website however you like. I am very familiar with CSS and have been using it since 2020. I understand most CSS concepts and can create responsive webpages that scale to many screens, such as a small phone screen up to a very large widescreen monitor. I am not familiar with any other CSS frameworks, although I am interested in learning about <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> in the future. </span> </div>
        
    <div class="tooltip" style="--language: 'JavaScript';"> <div class="progress">
            <div class="progressinner" style="width: 50%;"> 50% </div></div>
        <span class="tooltiptext">JavaScript is a very versatile language mainly used for backend and frontend development for websites, but can also be used for many other purposes. I use JavaScript in almost every web application that I make and I have a lot of knowledge of how it works. However, I am unable to create many advanced applications and I do not have any knowledge in any other frameworks or libraries. I am very experienced with making AJAX applications using the latest JavaScript APIs, and I'm even able to create notification systems! I am interested in learning about some JavaScript libraries, but my projects so far haven't required them.</span> </div>
        
    <div class="tooltip" style="--language: 'Java';"> <div class="progress">
            <div class="progressinner" style="width: 10%;"> 10% </div></div>
        <span class="tooltiptext">I used to know Java very well, however I have since stopped using it (for now) to build applications. I completed multiple coding bootcamps that taught me the basics of Java, however I never fully utilized it and moved on. I started to really get into Java in 2018 but stopped using it in late 2020. As of now, I don't have much interest in learning more about it except for creating Minecraft servers. I only learned about the core Java functions and never got familiar with any libraries.</span> </div>
        
    <div class="tooltip" style="--language: 'Linux';"> <div class="progress">
            <div class="progressinner" style="width: 40%;"> 40% </div></div>
        <span class="tooltiptext">I have a lot of knowledge of how to manage Linux computers. I know many Linux commands and I am very comfortable with the terminal. I know how to use some more advanced programs, like systemctl or supervisorctl, and my editor of choice is nano. I also have a Raspberry Pi that I customized heavily and I am now using Raspbian Lite paired with XFCE with a completely custom desktop theme, which makes it super lightweight and fast. I also had 1 year of experience managing Minecraft servers that were running on Linux and got used to how servers worked during that time (2021). </span> </div>
        
    <div class="tooltip" style="--language: 'DaVinci Resolve';"> <div class="progress">
            <div class="progressinner" style="width: 30%;"> 30% </div></div>
        <span class="tooltiptext">DaVinci Resolve is a free video editor for creating advanced videos. I know how to use it very well and have created many videos with it. I have a lot of experience and knowledge of how to use it's basic features, plus some of the more advanced effects and transitions. I don't have any knowledge of it's music editor or any of its paid features.</span> </div>
        
        <div class="tooltip" style="--language: 'SQL';"> <div class="progress">
        <div class="progressinner" style="width: 50%;"> 50% </div></div>
    <span class="tooltiptext">SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a super simple programming language to manage databases. The syntax of SQL is almost like English! Because of this and my knowledge of databases, I can say that I'm fairly knowledgeable when it comes to SQL and MySQL databases. I have also been looking into MySQL alternatives, however I currently only know how to use MySQL.</span> </div>
