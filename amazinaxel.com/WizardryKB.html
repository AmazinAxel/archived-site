            <h1>How to Join WizardryKB:</h1>
            <h2>Self-hosted version:</h2>
            <p>To join the self-hosted version, launch Minecraft and click on the "Multiplayer" button. Then, click the "Add Server" button near the bottom. Enter the name: "WizardryKB" and the IP, "play.amazinaxel.com" and click Save. Now, just double click on the new server listing and join in on the fun!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Minehut Version:</h2>
            <p>Follow the same steps above, but enter the IP, "mc.minehut.com" and join the server. While you are in the lobby run the command, "/join WizardryKB" and you will be teleported right into WizardryKB Classic. There are a couple things to note about the Minehut version compared to the Self-hosted version:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will only have access to WizardryKB Classic on Minehut. Playing on the self-hosted version allows you to play minigames, Wizardry Skywars, Wizardry Prototype, Wizardry Parkour and all upcoming gamemodes and minigames. </li>
                <li>You will be able to experience new updates and features on the self-hosted version, because the Minehut version has an update delay of 1~3 days. </li>
                <li>You will have access to extra features such as ranks, a level system, a Hub for chatting / cosmetics, and much more! </li>
                <li>With the Minehut version, you will be able to play with more players and there are more player slots as compared to the self-hosted version. </li>
                <li>The Minehut server system allows other players to join, allowing you to fight more people. With the self-hosted version, there usually is less people playing.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Unique and Exciting</h1>
        <p>WizardryKB is not just your average Prisons and Skyblock server. We develop fun game ideas and build on it, to provide a feeling you won't find elsewhere. We take classic games such as Skywars and make it different from the original, adding our personal touch to make this server feel custom and magical.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
        <h1>Completely Custom</h1>
        <p>WizardryKB was completely built from the ground up to make everything feel custom. This server will feel like no other to you with our amazing visual effects, enhancement and feedback. We use completely custom code and plugins to provide WizardryKB with completely custom features that you won't find anywhere else.</p>
      </div>
  <div class="column">
        <h1>Minigames and Events</h1>
        <p>Yeah, yeah, every server has events. But WizardryKB is different, our events are completely new and exciting, leaving you to wonder when the next event is. We offer unique rewards such as limited and custom items, ranks, Tokens, and more. We also feature a wide variety of custom Minigames, allowing you to experience even more fun and excitement.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="column">
        <h1>And So Much More!</h1>
        <p>No P2W, completely polished codebase, community-oriented and a friendly community just adds on top of everything else we have to offer! We even focus on what matters to our players, providing them with a simple user-interface, well thought-out tutorials and help menus, and even subtle effects to just add that extra layer of polish. We care about our community, so we don't make this server Pay-to-win and we listen to the community by adding features that they want to see.</p>
